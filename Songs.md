## One of A Kind
(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpaPiRFxV5I)

He’s one of the kind who never get tired \
He’s one of the kind who knows what’s wrong and what’s right \
He doesn’t get old, he’s coffee cup is always half-full \
\
Sometimes he gets into his little four-wheeler \
He's driving around until the tank is out of filler \
He’s driving around until he ain’t got nothing to cut \
\
*** \
\
Whenever someone in trouble \
Whenever a friend needs help \
Just call up this guy \
And in a blink of an eye \
He's gonna show up \
And help you to stand \
\
*** \
\
He’s one of the kind who never go lying \
He’s one of the kind who never stop trying \
He doesn’t look back, he’s glass of beer is always half-through \
\
Sometimes he gets into the space of tranquiller \
He's diving around until balloon is out of filler \
He’s diving around until he ain’t got nothing to see \
\
*** \
\
From highest Himalayan mountain \
To flattest of Texan land \
There’s no one like this guy \
With wide-open mind \
Who knows what’s driving \
The contemporary trend
