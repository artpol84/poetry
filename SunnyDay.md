## Sunny Day (a song of a crisis)
(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbBlJOgRoiw)

One day you’ll wake up\
In the morning light\
You will realize\
It was a stormy night\
But it’s over now\
And you can move along\
Ohh, now it’s all gone\
It’s time to move along 

Looking back you’ll see\
Months of darkness and clouds\
You’ll remember what\
It was all about\
But it’s over now\
And you can move along\
Ohh, now it’s all gone\
It’s time to move along

\*\*\* 

If you need me\
If you trust me\
I’m your friend right now

All is over\
The storm went nowhere\
So take a deep breath now

\*\*\*

Sun is shining bright\
People smiling, time flies\
Everyone is a friend\
No sadness in your eyes\
Bad things are in the past\
You know you're on the right track\
So many things to do\
There is no time to sit back

Brand new view from the room\
Brand new air from outside\
Never running low\
Always feeling all right\
Bad things are in the past\
You know you're on the right track\
So many things to do\
There is no time to sit back

\*\*\*

If you need me\
If you trust me\
I’m your friend right now

All is over\
The storm went nowhere\
So take a deep breath now
