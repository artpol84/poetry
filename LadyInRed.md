# Lady In Red

Record: https://youtu.be/xp6F3e6pFxc

\* \* \*

The morning comes \
Without any threat \
No strict plans \
Off the top of my head \
\
Familiar face \
Flicker in the crowd \
The lost trace \
That was always around \
\
I didn’t see it coming \
I’m not prepared to resist \
The wind is soothing and charming \
It’s blowing stuff off my list \
\
And now I’m thinking \
Of lady in red \
That’s not what I meant \
That’s not what I meant \
\
This thought runs through \
The far distant sky \
Don’t ask me why \
Don’t ask me why \
\
\* \* \*
\
The moment pass \
It never comes back \
The goosebumps \
All over my hand \
\
The slight click \
Up in the sky \
I feel so bad \
But I don’t know why \
\
I didn’t see it coming \
I’m not prepared to resist \
The wind is soothing and charming \
It’s blowing stuff off my list \
\
And now I’m thinking \
Of lady in red \
That’s not what I meant \
That’s not what I meant \
\
This thought runs through \
The far distant sky \
Don’t ask me why \
Don’t ask me why \
\
\* \* \*
\
Now I  knew it all \
But something has changed \
A great fall \
With no chance of revenge \
\
I think of \
The lady in red \
Oh that’s not what I meant \
That’s not what I meant \
\
I didn’t see it coming \
I have no will to resist \
The wind is soothing and charming \
It’s blowing stuff off my list \
\
And now I’m thinking \
Of lady in red \
That’s not what I meant \
That’s not what I meant \
\
This thought runs through \
The far distant sky \
Don’t ask me why \
Don’t ask me why \
\
\* \* \*
\
I didn’t see it coming \
I have no will to resist\
The wind is soothing and charming \
It’s blowing stuff off my list\
\
And now I’m thinking \
Of lady in red\
That’s not what I meant \
That’s not what I meant \
\
This thought runs through \
The far distant sky\
Don’t ask me why\
Don’t ask me why
